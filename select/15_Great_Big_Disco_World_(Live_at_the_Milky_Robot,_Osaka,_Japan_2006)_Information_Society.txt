Never underestimate the power of boredom
Things don't have to happen, but they usually do
Touch me when you go to work so I can be certain
To spend another morning just dreaming of you

Give me something to do
Give me someone to love
Just give me anything
You know I can't get enough
Cuz it's a great big disco world

I know what you're looking for when places get crowded
I know how you like it when the disco ball spins
Shake it, baby
